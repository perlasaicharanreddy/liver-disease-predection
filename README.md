## Overview
Liver Disease Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of liver disease in patients based on their medical data. It features a user-friendly web interface and supports multiple machine learning models.

## Features
- Predicts liver disease using models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- Interactive web application built with Streamlit.
- Deployed on Heroku for easy access.
